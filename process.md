- 1 Setup new node project with npm init. Setup gitignore and README.md documentation.
- 2 install express server.
- 3 Setup express server to serve public files, frontend routes sending an html file and a demo api endpoint.
- 4 Also set body-parser to be able to read POST variables easily.
- 5 Setup webpack.config.js and dependencies to build vue components and sass
- 6 Set a couple of demo Vue components to be sure that the build process is working fine
- 7 Set an initial grid design to be able to view components while developing
- 8 Set fetch strategy to get information from api. The root component will fetch all the information and will pass it to components as props.
- 9 Initial fetch of placeholder hardcoded endpoint to test pipeline
- 10 Set nodemon as npm run dev script since I'll be updating server endpoints a lot
